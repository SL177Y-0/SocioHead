## Integration Guidelines

### Backend Integration Patterns

#### 1. Score Data Integration
For receiving score data from the backend:

```typescript
// In your component that receives backend data
const [score, setScore] = useState(0);

useEffect(() => {
  // Set up API call
  async function fetchScore() {
    const response = await fetch('/api/user/score');
    const data = await response.json();
    setScore(data.score);
  }
  
  fetchScore();
}, []);
```

#### 2. Referral System Integration
Backend requirements for referral functionality:

```typescript
// Example referral data structure
interface ReferralData {
  referralCode: string;  // User's unique referral code
  referredCount: number; // Number of successful referrals
  pointsEarned: number;  // Points earned from referrals
  rewards: string[];     // Available rewards
}

// Endpoint: /api/user/referrals
// Method: GET
// Response: ReferralData
```

#### 3. Leaderboard Data
Format for leaderboard data from backend:

```typescript
// Leaderboard entry structure
interface LeaderboardEntry {
  rank: number;
  username: string;
  avatar?: string;
  telegramScore?: number;
  walletScore?: number;
  twitterScore?: number;
  totalScore: number;
}

// Endpoint: /api/leaderboard?timeframe=weekly
// Method: GET
// Response: LeaderboardEntry[]
```

## Performance Considerations

- All animations run client-side with minimal server impact
- Consider implementing pagination for leaderboard with large datasets
- Modal content is loaded only when needed to optimize initial page load
- Social sharing features use native browser APIs where available

## Browser Compatibility

The updates have been tested and confirmed working on:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)

Mobile responsiveness has been maintained throughout all changes.
